We discuss the nature of obfuscated names and the problems they cause, and introduce the concepts of intermediate mappings and human-readable mappings and how they fix the problems of obfuscated mappings. We also briefly discuss how mappings are present in the development and production environments of Minecraft, and interspersed throughout the post are examples of the various mappings in play throughout the Minecraft modding community, including Mojmaps.</description></item></channel></rss>
